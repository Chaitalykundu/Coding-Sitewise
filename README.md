# Small tips:

- number of subset = (2 to the power n) 2^n = 1<<n
- a << b = a \* (2^b) (2 to the power b)
- a >> b = a / (2^b) (2 to the power b)

&nbsp;

## XOR operation

- XOR of similar number is 0

# Time Complexity

| Operations            | Time Complexity |
| --------------------- | --------------- |
| pow(n,a)              | O(1)            |
| min()                 | O(1)            |
| n/2                   | O(n)            |
| n/2 in each iteration | O(log(n))       |
