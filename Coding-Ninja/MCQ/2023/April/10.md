# 1. What will be the output of the following code?

```java
public class test{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        try{
            int a = 0;
            System.out.print("a = " + a + " ")
            int b = 20/a;
            System.out.print("b = " + b)
        }
        catch(ArithmeticException e){
            System.out.print("Divided by zero error")
        }
        finally{
            System.out.print("Inside the finally block")
        }
    }
}

```

### a=0 Divided by zero error Inside the finally block

# 2. Statement: Sachin's mother instructed him to return home by train if it rains heavily.

```md
Assumptions:
I. Sachin may not be able to decide himself if it rains heavily.
II. The train may ply even if it rains heavily.
```

### only Assumptions II is implicit

> Sachin's mother has instructed him as a matter of caution and out of care for her child, and not because Sachin himself would not be able to decide. So, I is not implicit. Besides, Sachin's mother instructs him to take to train journey in case it rains heavily. So, II is implicit.

    }
    else if(c>=a && c>=b){
        cout << "hi";
