# 1. what would be the answer of the python code ?

```py
Class A:
    def test1(self):
        print("method named test1 of A called")

Class B(A):
    def test1(self):
        print("method named test1 of B called")
        super().test1()

Class C(A):
    def test1(self):
        print("method named test1 of C called")
        super().test1()

Class D(B,C):
    def test2(self):
        print("method named test1 of D called")

object1 = D()
object1.test1()
```

### method named test1 of B called method named test1 of C called method named test1 of A called

# 2. Which block write the code that might throw an exception?

### try

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 3. Total number of inheritance present in CPP is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 5

&nbsp;

> There are total 5 inheritance in CPP. They are **Single inheritance, Multilevel inheritance, Multiple inheritance, hierarchical inheritance, hybrid inheritance**

&nbsp;

# 4. Destructor of a class is used \_\_\_\_\_

### to destroy an object when the lifetime of an object ends

> Here we are iterating reverse from the start

##5. What will be the output of the following code

```java
public class Solution{
    public Solution(){
        System.out.println("Default constructor called");
    }

    public Solution(int x){
        System.out.println("Parameterized constructor called");
    }

    public static void main(String args[]){
        Solution obj = new Solution();
    }
}
```

### Default constructor called

&nbsp;

> When we create an object of a class, Default constructor is called
