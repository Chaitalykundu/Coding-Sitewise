## 1. The sum of money at simple interest tripled in 6 years. In how many years would it become 12 times itself?

### = > 33

```md
Let total amount was 100. after 6 years it become tripled means 300. So in 6 year it increased 200.
Hence in every 6 years it will increase 200 rs.

after 12 years it will be 500 (100+200+200)
after 18 years it will be 700
after 24 years it will be 900
after 30 years it will be 11000
now still 100 rs needed

To increase 100 rs still 3 years needed.

So total 33 years needed become 12 times itself
```

## 2. A+B+C = 20, A,B,C are all integers. How many solutions does it have if A>=2, B>=2,C>=2?

### 16C2 + 1

```md
2 minimum have to be given among 3 people. So, 20-6 = 14 are left. now 14 are to be distributed .

here n = 14 and r = 3
SO, total number of distribution = (14+3-1)C(3-1) + 1 = 16C2+1
```

## 3. What will be the output of the following code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int a = 10;

    if(a<15){
        time: cout << a;
        goto time;
    }
    break;
    return 0;
}
```

### Compile time error

> break statement needs to be presented inside a loop or switch statement

## 5. What will be the output of the following code

```java
    public class Solution{
        public static void main(String args[]){
            int i = 2;
            switch(i){
                case 1:
                    System.out.print("Case 1"+" ");
                    break;
                case 2:
                    System.out.print("Case 2"+" ");
                case 3:
                    System.out.print("Case 3"+" ");
                case 4:
                    System.out.print("Case 4"+" ");
            }
        }
    }
```
