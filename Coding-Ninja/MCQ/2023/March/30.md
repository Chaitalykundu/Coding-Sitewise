### = > c

&nbsp;

## 2. We can use instanceof operator to check if an object is

```
    a. an instance of a class
    b. an instance of a subclass
    c. an instance of a class that implements a particular interface
    d. all
```

### = > d

&nbsp;

## 3. What will be the output of the following code

```py
for i in range(0,2,-1):
    print("Hello")
```

### = > No output

> The step size is negative and the end is greater than the start. So the loop will not execute

&nbsp;

## 4. What will be the output of the following code

```java
    public class Solution{
        static int x =10;

        public static void main(String args[]){
            System.out.println(x);
        }
    }
```

### = > 10

> The variable x is a static variable and it can be easily accessed inside the static method without creating any object of the class.

&nbsp;

## 5. Which datatype is consider as a non-primitive datatype?

### = > class

> Array, string and class are noo-primitive datatype
