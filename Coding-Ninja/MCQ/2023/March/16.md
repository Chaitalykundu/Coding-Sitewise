### = > 1 1 1

```
 N.B : the super.__init__() in the subclass two and three has been properly invoked and none of the subclasses returns any other value. Hence 1 is returned each time the object is created and printed
```

## 2. Your IP address is 172.16.13.5 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.128. What are the categories of your address, subnet address and broadcast address?

### => class B, subnet 172.16.13.0 broadcast address 172.16.13.127

```
 N.B : 172 belongs to class B (128 to 191) of IPv4 addresses.

From the subnet mask, we get that this category is divided into two subnet : 172.16.13.0 to 172.16.13.127 and 172.16.13.128 to 172.16.13.255

IP 172.16.13.5 is the first subnet. So the start address 172.16.13.0 is the subnet address and the last address 172.16.13.127 is the broadcast address
```
